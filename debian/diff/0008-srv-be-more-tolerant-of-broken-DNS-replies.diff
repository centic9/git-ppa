Subject: srv: be more tolerant of broken DNS replies

At a hotel with a very broken Wi-Fi setup, Richard found his copy
of git unable to cope:

	% git clone git://git.kitenet.net/mr
	Cloning into 'mr'...
	error: cannot initialize DNS parser: Message too long
	fatal: Unable to look up git.kitenet.net

Other programs gave some warnings but otherwise worked fine.  From a
packet capture, it seems that the response to a SRV query for
_git._tcp.git.kitenet.net in this setup was a single A resource record
pointing to the link-local address 169.254.1.1, followed by two
trailing bytes: c0 1a.  The trailing bytes cause the underlying parser
to fail.

It would not be good to silently tolerate this and similar kinds of
brokenness, but working around it would help people on affected
systems to recover.  Luckily RFC2782 gives us enough leeway to act as
we please for this particular kind of error, so give a warning and
fall back to an A/AAAA query (which should work).

Similarly, if we receive non-SRV RRs in response to a SRV query,
RFC2782 does not say to error out, so in the spirit of graceful
degradation let's warn and skip those records.
