Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
 Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision
 tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web
 interface, is provided as separate git* packages.

 git-core package is now obsolete, and can safely be removed from the
 system if no other package depends on it.

 This package provides the git cvsimport, cvsexportcommit, and cvsserver
 tools, which allow Git to read from and write to CVS repositories and
 offer access over CVS protocol to Git repositories.
 .
 The git cvsimport tool can incrementally import from a repository that
 is being actively developed and only requires remote access over CVS
 protocol. Unfortunately, in many situations the import leads to
 incorrect results. For reliable, one-shot imports, cvs2git from the
 cvs2svn package or parsecvs may be a better fit.

 This package provides two modules for integration with Emacs:
 .
  * git.el:
 .
    Status manager that displays the state of all the files of the
    project and provides easy access to the most frequently used git
    commands. The user interface is intended to be similar to the
    pcl-cvs mode. It can be started with `M-x git-status'.
 .
  * git-blame.el:
 .
    Emacs implementation of incremental "git blame".  When you turn it
    on while viewing a file, the editor buffer will be updated by
    setting the background of individual lines to a color that reflects
    which commit it comes from.
 .
 This package does not contain the VC-mode backend for git. That is
 part of standard Emacs distributions, starting with version 22.2.
 .

 If libcgi-fast-perl is installed, gitweb can also be run over FastCGI
 (and served by nginx, for example).
